@par Example Description 

How to configure and use GPIOs through the HAL API.

On STM32F4xx-Nucleo, PA05 GPIO pin is linked to LED2 - Green.
Main function configures GPIO in output pushpull mode, then in while loop, HAL 
toggle pin function is called.

The HCLK is configured at 100 MHz for STM32F410xx Devices.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The clock setting is configured to have the max product performance (max clock frequency) 
      so not optimized in term of power consumption.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F410xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F4xx-Nucleo RevC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
   

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
