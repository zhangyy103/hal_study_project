@par Example Description 

This example shows how to synchronize TIM1 and Timers (TIM3 and TIM4) in parallel mode.

Timers synchronization in parallel mode:


                                                       ___________ 
                                                 ITR0 |  SLAVE 1  |
                                     _________________|    TIM3   |
   ___________                      |                 |___________|
  |   MASTER  |TRGO_Update          |                 
  |    TIM1   |---------------------|               
  |___________|                     |                  ___________ 
                                    |_________________|  SLAVE 2  |
                                                 ITR0 |    TIM4   |
                                                      |___________|
                         

1/ TIM1 is configured as Master Timer:
   - PWM Mode is used
   - The TIM1 Update event is used as Trigger Output 
 
2/ TIM3 and TIM4 are slaves for TIM1,
   - PWM Mode is used
   - The ITR0(TIM1) is used as input trigger for both slaves
   - Gated mode is used, so starts and stops of slaves counters
     are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(update event).

The TIM1 counter clock is 168 MHz.

  The Master Timer TIM1 is running at:
  TIM1 frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 656 KHz
  and the duty cycle is equal to: TIM1_CCR1/(TIM1_ARR + 1) = 50%

  The TIM3 is running at: 
  (TIM1 frequency)/ ((TIM3 period +1)* (TIM1_Repetition_Counter+1)) = 43.730 KHz and
  a duty cycle equal to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 33.3%

  The TIM4 is running at:
  (TIM1 frequency)/ ((TIM4 period +1)* (Repetition_Counter+1)) = 65.600 KHz and
  a duty cycle equal to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 50%


The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F407xx/417xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL RevC 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM324xG-EVAL RevC Set-up 
   Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1 CH1 (PA.08)
      - TIM3 CH1 (PC.06)
      - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
