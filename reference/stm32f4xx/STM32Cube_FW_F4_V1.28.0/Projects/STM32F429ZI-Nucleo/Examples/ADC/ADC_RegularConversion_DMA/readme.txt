@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously converted data from 
ADC1 to memory.

The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_10.

Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

In this example, the system clock is 180MHz, APB2 = 90MHz and ADC clock = APB2/4. 
Since ADC1 clock is 22.5 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/22.5= 0.66us(1.5Msps).

User can vary the ADC_CHANNEL_10 voltage by applying an input voltage on pin3 connector 9
(connected to PC.00) 

STM32 boards LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED1 is ON when the conversion is complete.
  - LED2 is ON when there is an error in ADC initialization, in ADC channel configuration 
    or during conversion process.
