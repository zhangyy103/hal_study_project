@par Example Description 

How to configure and use GPIOs through the HAL API.

On STM32F4xx-Nucleo RevC, PA05 
gpio pin is linked to LED2 - Green.
Main function conigures gpio on output pushpull mode, then in while loop, HAL 
toggles pin function is called.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 84 MHz.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F401xEx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F4xx-Nucleo RevB 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
