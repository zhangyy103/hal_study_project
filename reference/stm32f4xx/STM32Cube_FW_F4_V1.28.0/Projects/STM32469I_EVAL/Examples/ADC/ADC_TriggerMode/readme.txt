@par Example Description 

How to use ADC and TIM2 to continuously convert data from an ADC channel. 
Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new conversion is started 
by the ADC.

Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new conversion is started by ADC3.

At the end of conversion, an interrupt is generated and the converted data of 
ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the ADC 
conversion complete call back function (HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback).

The timer is used to trigger an ADC measure at 20 KHz.

Configuration of the timer to trig an ADC measure at 20 Khz:
  From the reference manual, Reset and Clock control part, Timer 2 is clocked on PCLK1.
  The function SystemClock_Config() configures the clock divider as follows:
  1) The system clock is 180 MHz.
  2) AHB  Prescaler = 1 => AHB clock is 180 MHz.
  3) APB1 Prescaler = 4 => PCLK1 clock is 180 MHz/4 = 45 MHz.
  4) For Timer 2, as APB1 Prescaler = 4, Timer 2 Clock is PCLK1 clock X 2 = 180 MHz/2.
  5) APB2 Prescaler = 2 => PCLK2 clock is 180 MHz/2 = 90 MHz.
  6) For ADC, as ADC Prescaler = 4, ADC Clock is PCLK2 clock / 4 = 22.5 MHz.

  For a 20 Khz frequency, we need (180 MHz/2) / 20 KHz = 4500 clock cycle.
  So, in TIM_Config function, we set the following period: htim.Init.Period = 4500;

Please select PC0 option on JP3 jumper called Potentiometer

The voltage on pin PC.0 (ADC_CHANNEL_10)can vary using the board potentiometer RV1.
The converted value is monitored through debugger: uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

Remark: LED3 is ON when there is an error in initialization.

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the boards power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx/STM32F479xx devices.

  - This example has been tested and validated with STM32469I-EVAL RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM32469I-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (RV1) of the Eval board (connected to  PC.0).
    - Make sure that JP3 is fitted in 2-3 positions to use potentiometer.
