@par Application Description 

This application shows how to use the USB host application based on the Human Interface Class (HID) on the STM32F4xx devices.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F469xx USB OTG Host peripheral to interact with an USB 
HID Device such as a Mouse or a Keyboard.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from a specific output of two PLLs PLL or PLL SAI.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

The 48 MHz clock for the USB FS can be derived from one of the two following sources:
  – PLL clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLL as clock source, the PLL clock must be programmed
    to output 48 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLVCO/PLLQ).
  – PLLSAI clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLLSAI as clock source, the PLLSAI clock must be programmed
    to output 48 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLSAIVCO/PLLSAIP).

When the application is started, the connected HID device (Mouse/Keyboard) is detected in HID mode and 
gets initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a HID Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID, 
manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it on the LCD screen.
This application is based on interacting with a HID device (Mouse/Keyboard). It creates a normal 
priority thread, that executes a HID routine.

User button is used to start the appropriate HID application:
   - Mouse connected: Moving the mouse will move the pointer in the display rectangle
     and if a button is pressed, the corresponding rectangle will be highlighted in Blue.
   - Keyboard connected: Taped Keyboard characters are displayed on the LCD screen.

@note In case of using an AZERTY keyboard, user should add "AZERTY_KEYBOARD" define to ensure correct 
      displaying taped characters.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct 
      HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set according to the OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720  
"STM32Cube USB Host library".

@par USB Library Configuration
      
It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file "usbh_conf.h" available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

Since this is an RTOS based application, built around FreeRTOS and CMSIS-OS wrapping layer common APIs,
the RTOS is enabled by setting, #define USBH_USE_OS      1

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F469xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32469I-Discovery 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - This application is configured to run by default on STM32469I-DISCO RevC board.
  - In order to run this application on RevA or RevB boards, replace the flag 
    USE_STM32469I_DISCO_REVC, which is defined in the pre-processor options, by 
    either USE_STM32469I_DISCO_REVA or USE_STM32469I_DISCO_REVB respectively.

  - STM32469I-Discovery Set-up
    - Plug a USB device mouse or keyboard into the STM32469I-Discovery board 
      through 'USB micro A-Male to A-Female' cable
      - CN13: to use USB Full Speed (FS)
