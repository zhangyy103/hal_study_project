@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the different BSP drivers. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the systemclock (SYSCLK) 
to run at 84 MHz.

This example shows how to use the different functionalities of Gyroscope L3GD20 
and Accelerometer LSM303DLHC, Audio device CS43L22 and ST MEMS microphone (MP45DT02)
by switching between all tests using USER button. 

Firstly, push the User button to start first Test.  
4 LEDs will blink between each test.Press user key to start another test:

     1) ACCELEROMETER_MEMS_Test.    Device: "LSM303DLHC"
        LEDs 3,4,5 and 6 show board orientation. (X and Y axis)       
        
     2) GYROSCOPE_MEMS_Test.        Device: "L3GD20"
        LEDs 3,4,5 and 6 show board movement. (X and Y axis)   
     
     3) AudioPlay_Test(Need headphone). Device: "CS43L22"
        Plug a headphone to ear a 48K sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
        Default volume is 50%.
        A click on the board will pause the audio file play (LED6 & LED4 ON). 
		    Another click resumes audio file play (only LED6 on)
        @Note: Copy file "/Utilities/Media/Audio/art_of_gard_128K.bin" directly 
        in the STM32 flash at @0x08080000 

     3) AudioRecord_Test. Device: "MP45DT02"
        Record your voice (2 or 3 secs)
        When LED6 turns on, Plug a headphone to ear a 16K sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
        Default volume is 70%.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on and STM32F401xCx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F401-Discovery RevB 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Use STLink utility, available on www.st.com or any other in system programming
    tool to load "/Utilities/Media/Audio/art_of_gard_128K.bin" file to the STM32 
    internal flash at the address 0x08020000.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
