@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC3 and DMA to transfer continuously converted data from 
ADC3 to memory.

The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously channel8(for STM324x9I-EVAL RevB).

Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC3 DR register to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

In this example, the system clock is 144MHz, APB2 = 72MHz and ADC clock = APB2/2. 
Since ADC3 clock is 36 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/36= 0.41us(2.4Msps).

User can vary the ADC3 channel8(for STM324x9I-EVAL RevB) voltage using the Eval Board potentiometer

STM32 Eval boards LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the conversion is complete.
 - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM324x9I-EVAL RevB evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (RV1) of the Eval board (connected to PF.10).


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
