@par Example Description

  This example provides a description of how to configure LTDC peripheral to 
  display BMP image on LCD using only one layer.
  In this basic example the goal is to explain the different fields of the LTDC 
  structure. 

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
  clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz.
  
  After LCD initialization, the LCD layer 1 is configured to display image 
  (modeled by an array) loaded from flash memory.

 @note : 
 The C file of the image used in this example are generated with 
 STemWin bitmap converter released with this package.

  Each LCD device has its specific synchronous timings values.
  This example uses AM480272H3TMQW-T01H LCD (MB1046 Rev.A) and configures 
  the synchronous timings as following :

  Horizontal Synchronization (Hsync) = 41
  Horizontal Back Porch (HBP)        = 2
  Active Width                       = 480
  Horizontal Front Porch (HFP)       = 2

  Vertical Synchronization (Vsync)   = 10
  Vertical Back Porch (VBP)          = 2
  Active Height                       = 272
  Vertical Front Porch (VFP)         = 2
  
  LCD_TFT windowing configuration :
  ---------------------------------

  To configure the active display window, this example configures the 
  horizontal/vertical start and stop. 

  HorizontalStart = (Offset_X + Hsync + HBP);
  HorizontalStop  = (Offset_X + Hsync + HBP + Window_Width - 1); 
  VarticalStart   = (Offset_Y + Vsync + VBP);
  VerticalStop    = (Offset_Y + Vsync + VBP + Window_Heigh - 1);
  
  Window_width and Window_heigh should be in line with the image size to be 
  displayed.

STM32 Eval boards LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in Init process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
