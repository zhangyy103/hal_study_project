@par Example Description

Configuration of the TIM peripheral to
  – generate three center-aligned PWM and complementary PWM signals
  – insert a defined dead time value
  – use the break feature
  – lock the desired parameters
This example is based on the STM32F1xx TIM LL API.
The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary
services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

TIM1CLK is fixed to 72 MHz, the TIM1 Prescaler is set to have
TIM1 counter clock = 10 MHz.

The TIM1 auto-reload is set to generate PWM signal at 10 KHz:
               
The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description: 
The channel 1 duty cycle is set to 50% so channel 1N is set to 50%.
The channel 2 duty cycle is set to 25% so channel 2N is set to 75%.
The channel 3 duty cycle is set to 12.5% so channel 3N is set to 87.5%.

A dead time equal to 4 us is inserted between 
the different complementary signals, and the Lock level 1 is selected.
  - The OCx output signal is the same as the reference signal except for the rising edge,
    which is delayed relative to the reference rising edge.
  - The OCxN output signal is the opposite of the reference signal except for the rising
    edge, which is delayed relative to the reference falling edge

Note that calculated duty cycles apply to the reference signal (OCxREF) from
which outputs OCx and OCxN are generated. As dead time insertion is enabled the
duty cycle measured on OCx will be slightly lower.
  
The break Polarity is used at High level.

The TIM1 waveforms can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F103xB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F103RB-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F103RB-Nucleo Set-up
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  PA.08: connected to pin 8 of CN9 connector  
      - TIM1_CH1N PB.13: connected to pin 30 of CN10 connector 
      - TIM1_CH2  PA.09: connected to pin 1 of CN5 connector 
      - TIM1_CH2N PB.14: connected to pin 28 of CN10 connector 
      - TIM1_CH3  PA.10: connected to pin 3 of CN9 connector 
      - TIM1_CH3N PB.15: connected to pin 26 of CN10 connector 

    - Connect the TIM1 break to the GND. To generate a break event, switch this
      pin level from 0V to 3.3V.  
      - TIM1_BKIN  PB.12: connected to pin 16 of CN10 connector 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
